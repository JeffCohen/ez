Description:
    Generates an example of one entire database-backed resource, from model
    and migration to controller and views. The resource is ready to use as a
    starting point for your RESTful, resource-oriented application.

    Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attributes are field arguments specifying the model's attributes. You can
    optionally pass the type and an index to each field. For instance:
    "title body:text tracking_id:integer:uniq" will generate a title field of
    string type, a body with text type and a tracking_id as an integer with an
    unique index. "index" could also be given instead of "uniq" if one desires
    a non unique index.

    Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to specify them by hand
    as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'starter:resource post title body:text published:boolean' gives
    you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them all, as well as the Golden Seven "RESTful" routes
    in config/routes.rb.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, first rollback your migration
    with 'rake db:rollback' if you've already run 'rake db:migrate'.  Then run
    'rails destroy starter:resource ModelName'.

Examples:
    `rails generate starter:resource post title body:text published:boolean`
    `rails generate starter:resource purchase amount:decimal tracking_id:integer:uniq`
